# Real-Estate
 A real estate agency wanted to reduce the negotiation time and improve closure for buyers and
sellers of homes by ensuring that both sides were advised well on the home's potential sale/purchase price. To that
end, the agency wanted to predict a transaction price for all the houses in its market which would be as close as
possible to a price where the transaction would take place. Data regarding all possible variables and qualities of
over 10,000 houses sold in the past were collected and analysed.
Solution- Built a predictive model using Random Forest Algorithm and compared the result with Linear
Regression and Decision Tree algorithms to arrive at a potential transaction price for all future transactions. Over
the next 6 months, negotiation time was brought down from 3 weeks on average to 8 days. Deal closure went up
by 28%
